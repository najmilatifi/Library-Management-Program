📚 Library Management System

A console-based Java application built to simulate the operations of a library — including book borrowing, returns, late fee handling, and user access — all crafted from scratch with a focus on object-oriented programming.

📝 Description

This Library Management System was developed using core Java and OOP principles without relying on external frameworks or AI tools. It includes separate access for staff and customers, a login and registration system, and the use of input files to store and manage book data dynamically. Every feature was self-conceptualized and implemented with clean logic and structure.
